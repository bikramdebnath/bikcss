          <h4>Fullstack Web Devoloper</h4>
          <p>
            A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client
            and server software. In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she
            also knows how to: Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery,
            Angular, or Vue) Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or
            Node) Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)

          <h4>Book</h4>
          <p>
            A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing
            or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus,
            parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a
            cover.[1] it can also be handwritten or printed work of fiction or
            nonfiction, usually on sheets of paper fastened or bound together
            within covers. The technical term for this physical arrangement is
            codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical
            supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex
            replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a
            leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.

          <h4>Bike Riding</h4>
          <p>
            While some of us are skeptical about this particular advantage,
            riding a motorcycle can ideally make you feel great while also
            making you look cool. Mostly, riding a motorbike can afford you a
            slight edge over others, with many seeing you as a cool adrenaline
            junkie boasting remarkable riding skills. But how does riding a
            motorcycle make you look cool? Although you may not know the
            perception others have about you, the reality is that they all want
            to be in your shoes. Ideally, this coolness comes with respect to
            how the fans and admirers accord you. This is not to say that you
            have to pull off some dangerous bike stunts to capture the attention
            of your fans to gain some form of respect. Rather, your coolness
            must come naturally.

          <h4>Desing and Devolopment</h4>
          <p>
            In this chapter, we will begin by presenting a general approach to
            modular design. In specific, we will discuss how to organize
            software blocks in an effective manner. The ultimate success of an
            embedded system project depends both on its software and hardware.
            Computer scientists pride themselves in their ability to develop
            quality software. Similarly electrical engineers are well-trained in
            the processes to design both digital and analog electronics.
            Manufacturers, in an attempt to get designers to use their products,
            provide application notes for their hardware devices. The main
            objective of this class is to combine effective design processes
            together with practical software techniques in order to develop
            quality embedded systems. As the size and especially the complexity
            of the software increase, the software development changes from
            simple "coding" to "software engineering", and the required skills
            also vary along this

          <h4>Artificial Inteligents</h4>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving,
            synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as
            opposed to intelligence displayed by humans or by other animals.
            Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition,
            computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as
            other mappings of inputs.[1] AI applications include advanced web
            search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used
            by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such
            as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or
            creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and
            competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as
            chess and Go).
